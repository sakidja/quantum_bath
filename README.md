# Quantum Bath Simulation

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for simulating structured quantum baths using **QuTiP**. The models are designed for studying:

- Open quantum system dynamics
- Non-Markovian effects
- Lindblad master equations
- Coupling topologies and memory transfer

## Features
- Multi-qubit structured bath modeling
- Thermal Lindblad dissipation and entropy tracking
- Diagnostic plots: entropy, fidelity, populations, entanglement, and trace distance
- FFT-based spectral analysis for memory and coherence signatures

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- [QuTiP](https://qutip.org)
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## How to Run
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sakidja/quantum_bath.git
cd quantum_bath
